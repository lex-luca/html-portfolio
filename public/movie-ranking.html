<h1>My favourite movies and anime</h1>

<h2>These really have a place in my heart (haha)</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Maze Runner</h3>

<p>This is a three movie series which I love because it's one of my favourite movie generes - lot's of action as well as sci-fi</p>  

<h3>Violet Evergarden</h3>

<p>This anime is, put simply - amazing. I love the beautiful artstyle, storyline and the characters. Even all of the soundtracks are breathtaking (I'm actually learning to play some of them on my flute).</p>

<h3>All of Makoto Shinkai's movies (also anime)</h3>

<p>They are masterpieces</p>

<h3>Demon Slayer</h3> 

<p>Love it love it love it (honesly I could go on and on with anime lolz)</p>

<h3>Tokyo ghoul</h3> 

<p>Made me cry more than half of the time while watching and reading, but it's really amazing</p>
